# ðŸš€ Judge0 Installation Guide using WSL and Docker
This guide walks you through setting up Judge0 v1.13.1 inside WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) with Docker and Docker Compose.

### ðŸ§° Prerequisites
Windows 10/11 with WSL enabled

```bash
# Install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
wsl --install

# Launch the Ubuntu distribution within WSL
wsl -d Ubuntu

# Update and upgrade system packages
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# (Optional) Edit GRUB configuration if required by Judge0 documentation
sudo nano /etc/default/grub

# Install Docker in the Linux environment (WSL)
sudo apt install -y docker.io

# Install Docker Compose to manage multiple containers
sudo apt install -y docker-compose

# Download the Judge0 release archive
wget https://github.com/judge0/judge0/releases/download/v1.13.1/judge0-v1.13.1.zip

# Unzip the downloaded archive
unzip judge0-v1.13.1.zip

# Navigate into the extracted Judge0 directory
cd judge0-v1.13.1

# Generate a strong random password for Redis and PostgreSQL
# Visit: https://www.random.org/passwords/?num=1&len=32&format=plain&rnd=new

# Edit the configuration file to set Redis and PostgreSQL credentials
nano judge0.conf
# (In nano: Ctrl+O to save, Enter to confirm, Ctrl+X to exit)

# Start only the 'db' and 'redis' services defined in docker-compose.yml
sudo docker-compose up -d db redis

# Verify that the services are running
sudo docker ps

# (Optional) Stop and remove the running containers
sudo docker-compose down

# Exit the WSL environment
exit
```





We can also use the judge0 which is hosted on rapid api or other platform to get access directly from and send our code to them and execute it.
